    #NEED To write logger function

    #NOTE For the first computation we have nothing in the data base so initially solving it with a DP approach

    #Done: 1. First sort the questions into 3 seperate sub-dictionaries based on the difficulty 
    #Done: 2. Record the input of the difficulty of marks that is required will get the input from command line 
    #Done: 3. Traverse through this sub dictionary and find all the possible combinations of questions that sum up to that value
    #Done: 4. Store this list of lists in an dictionary again 
    #Done: 5. Put randomized list in the quetion paper then for all the categories and there you have your answer
    #Done: 6. Randomize the question paper
    #NOTE: For second computation onwards

    #TODO: 6. To search throught the existing db and use that 
    #TODO: 7. If present just use that list of lists in a randomized manner ---------------------- Aim to save computation
    #TODO: 8. If not present I will just look at the value that is required if its greater than the max value in db then will use
    #TODO: 9. First find the number and subtract the max marks question from that category and see if that exist in our db -------- Need to do some kind of recursion memoized dp here

    #NOTE: Can jagged array be used? ----- I guess so 
    
    #NOTE: Few things to keep in mind: Memoization would have extra auxilary stack space so we can use tabular form to get the answer and 
    #to optimize the space even more we can use the prev and cur 1D arrays instead of a complete 2D array but in this case I guess we can not use the prev and curr concept as we need to 
    #store the keys and not just count it


    # 10 + 8 + 7 = 25, 8 ----------- consider next turn 33 aajaata h toh we can use 25+8 = 33 we can solve the duplicate issues by checking that question present in the qictionary or not
